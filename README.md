# Course Manager project

Over the next few weeks, we will work on building out a course manager. This project will be used by any institution that wants to manage courses, classes, students and so on.

## Week 1 assignments

Do all the work in the `public` folder.  
Fork `course-manager` into `course-manager-[teamname]`. Work on the problem with your teammates. 

### Student list

Primary goal: Render a list of students' first and last names to a page.  

Check out these demos in javascript-examples for reference:  

- dom/iterative-content.html & iterative-content.js

In `index.html` add a link to `students.html`.  
Create `students.html` and `students.js`. Include `students.js` in `students.html`.  
Remember that `students.js` will be a module, so add the correct attribute(s) to the `<script>` tag in `students.html`. 

In `students.js`:  
- Import students from `data/all-data.js`. 
- Iterate over each student
- Print the first name and last name for each student to the browser
	- Consider using an unordered list, although a table would be acceptable as well
	- Add any HTML you need to `students.html`. 
- Experiment along the way, if it helps break down the problem: 
	- After importing `students`, can you log it to the console?
	- Can you write a loop to go over `students` and log the student to the console?
	- Can you log the first name and last name? 
	- Can you dynamically write some HTML (prefer `insertAdjacentHTML`) to `students.html`? 

### Student details

Primary goal: Clicking on a student's name should reveal other details about the student

Demos/reference:  
- demos/events: Pretty much everything under here
- MDN [addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)

In `students.html`:  

- Import Bootstrap, if you haven't already
- Use Bootstrap (or regular CSS, if you prefer) to split the page in half vertically
- The left half should be the list of students by name from the previous section
- The right half will be reserved for student details

In `students.js`:  

- Add event handler(s) for each of the student names. Start by having the event handler log that it's been clicked
- Evolve the event handler so that it fetches the student's details out of the `students` array. Log the details to the console.
- Refine the event handler so that it builds some HTML with the student's details. Render the results to the other half of the `students.html` page. 
- Clicking on another student should clear away the previous value and replace it with the current student's information.
